For my Sinatra portfolio project, I created a CRUD app that lets you log bike rides. Summer is just around the corner, and I've taken out my bike for the season, so that is what inspired this project. I realized that all my rides seem to blend together, so I wanted a way to keep track of not only my physical mileage, but my mental mileage. This app allows you to log a ride and up to 3 associated feelings or notable memories. Because this is a CRUD app, you can also view, edit, and delete each of these rides. Here are some mockups:
